  ## Design
  Introduction to the design section.

  ### Anatomy
  The Anatomy is the breakdown of the component.

  [ Image breaking down the component’s anatomy ]

  Each part of the component in the image should be labelled with a number. Underneath, create a list of each of the labeled items, explaining what they are. This list should also indicate to the reader whenever an item is an optional include.

  Any specific notes on a part of the anatomy breakdown should be included here. This includes dos and don’ts with accompanying image examples.

  ### Sizing & Spacing
  Much like the Anatomy section, the Sizing & Spacing section should be a breakdown of the construction of the component. Red line guides should be added to the component, showing the spacing between the different anatomy parts.

  ### States (if applicable) 
  This section covers all the different component states including its default state, hover, active, and disabled.
